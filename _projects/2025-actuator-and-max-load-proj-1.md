In my Statics and Mechanics of Solids Course we were given the following mechanical design challenge:

Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of any fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator, we needed to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We were to assume the supports and the bar/actuator were rigid and were given an online catalog from which to choose an actuator, using maximum force values only.

For my proposed solution I chose to use a wooden plank of length 150cm which would rise to the maximum height of 50cm. It would be connected via fixed pin support to the bottom left corner of the fixed area and rotate counterclockwise about this support. The actuator would sit 140cm to the right of the corner support below the board and lift the board upward; this displacement of the actuator accounts for the change in horizontal "shadow" of the bar, which would decrease as the bar is lifted. The actuator which can lift the maximum weight in the provided online repository was the ditrectly below the far end of the RSX High Force Rod-Style Actuator which has a maximum possible applied force of 294kN. This means the maximum load lifted would be 294kN.
